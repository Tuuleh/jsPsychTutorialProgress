                    <h1>Welcome to our experiment for the jsPsych back end tutorial!</h1>
                    <p>
                        During the tutorial for deploying this experiment, you'll learn how to use node.js, Express and a MongoLabs instance of MongoDB to deploy your jsPsych experiment in the cloud, for free, without having to worry about hosting your own web server.
                        The tutorial will first cover how to deploy a <i>single</i> experiment. As a follow-up, I will write an updated tutorial on how to deploy a more complicated test battery, posting data after each individual test, routing to the next experiment and making sure there are no multiple entries for the same participant.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        We'll set up a web application that will serve your experiment pages and post data into a database instance you've created. 
                        As the last step in this tutorial, I'll show you how to access your data in order to export it to R 
                        or whichever solution you prefer for data analysis.
